# For Lab 2:

# This lab introduces f-strings, a more modern way of formatting strings in Python. 

# I will define two variables: city (string) and temperature (float).
# I will then go ahead to Use an f-string to create a sentence with these variables.

# The general structure would be:

city        = "Blackwood"
temperature = 25.7

Result = f"The current temperature in {city} is {temperature}Â°C"

print(Result)
