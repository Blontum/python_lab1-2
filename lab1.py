# For Lab 1:

# In this lab i am to use the format() method to create a formatted string. 

# I will define three variables: my first_name (string), my age (integer), and my favorite_color (string).
#  I will then use  format() method to create a sentence with these variables.

#The general structure would be:

first_name = "Bo"
age        = 65
color      = " Red"

output = "Hello, my name is {}. I am {} years old, and my favorite color is {}.".format(first_name, age, color )
